{"input": "write me a good dad joke", "output": "The Origins of Norwegians People ask me sometimes, they say, \"Glenn\", ( they are wise to seek my counsel on this matter), \"how is it that Norsemen came to be known as \"Norwegians\"?\"\n\nAnd I smile a little patronizing smile, because, despite my appearance matching some of the classic images of Vikings, I am not actually Norwegian.  And thus I am eminently qualified for just this sort of question.  It's tough to not cross over into condescension.  But my audience requires my attention...\n\nYou see, back in days of Yore, when Norsemen first got it in their heads that the Brits and the Picts were a puny lot, ripe for the harvest so to speak, they first scouted the area by pretending to be tourists.  They found themselves a nice sidewalk cafe operated by a couple limey weasels, and set their boots heavily on the outdoor table and ordered up a corned beast suitable to their needs.  And ale.  They needed some ale.  You can't smash a horn down and demand \"more ale, wench!\" In a loud, commanding voice if you haven't had any in the first place.\n\nThe waitress was a slip of a lass, dark-complected,   Demure and quiet to match her appearance.  She stammered out that, being a Green Initiative business, Ale was not only unavailable but philosophically out of place.  But they had some lovely tea with a hint of lavender...\n\nThorrfin Skullsplitter leaned forward at this news, and bellowed, \"we are not teetotalers!\", pounding his fist on the iron-lace table.\n\nLenny Mcgreasel, one of the cafe's two owners, heard the commotion and injected a condescending servants whine to the conversation, \" is there anything we can bring the large gentlemen from our menu?\", gesticulating to the hand-crafted hemp/flaxseed menu depicting what could better be described as a garden, rather than a list of things to eat.\n\nThorrfin's  mate, Snorri Log-bender, immediately ordered, as if he'd been thinking about this moment for some time, \"what I'd like is to have some bacon salad\"\n\nThorrfin was still muttering in his beard over not being a teetotaler.  \" I'm sorry sir, we only serve as food that which has grown fresh from the garden\"' the waitress  chirped.  That was the last straw.  With a shove of his boot, and a full dose of disgust, the table flew backwards.\n\n\"C'mon, Snorri\", he said in disgust, and he stood, once again emoting, \"we are not teetotalers\"\n\nJust then another small-faced waitress popped around the corner carrying tofu laced with kale and and whole-grain brown rice.  Snorri saw his chance, and with a face of disgust he emoted, \n\n\"Nor Vegans\"\n\nAnd with that they bid  their their host a hostile farewell, only to return two weekends later with a fully armed force of Vikings,- and established what would become the preeminent fast food of a millennia, fish and chips, served only with the darkest stout.\n\nTo hear the English say it, you'd think now it had been their idea all along. \n\n\nAnd that, children, is how it really happened."}

This would have been the largest single shipment  of mayonnaise ever delivered to Mexico. The Mexican people loved Mayonnaise so much and this loss was so devastating that the Mexican people declared a National day of Mourning which happens every year on the day the shipment was supposed to arrive. This day of course is May 5th or more commonly known as Sinko de Mayo."}
